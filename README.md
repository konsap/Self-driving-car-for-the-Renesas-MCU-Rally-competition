# Self-driving-car-for-the-Renesas-MCU-Rally-competition

Renesas' first virtual student robotics contest. Engineering students and their educators from universities all over Europe are tasked with building a self-guided MCU robot in the Renesas Virtual MCU Rally simulation environment and optimize the software that auto drives the robot along the white line on the track.
